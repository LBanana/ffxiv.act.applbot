# ffxiv.act.applbot
applbot is an ACT plugin that covers robot, callouts, event broadcast, and timeline for FFXIV boss encounters.

## Installation
1. Download and unblock (if neccesary) .zip file from releases section (https://github.com/applepudding/ffxiv.act.applbot/releases).
2. Extract .zip to ACT Folder (applbot folder inside ACT main folder)
3. Make sure ACT is run as administrator and is allowed through firewall!

## Usage
er ... add+enable it in ACT - plugin listing and try out :) 
Make sure ACT reset is set to around 40s or 50s. Options - Main Table/Encounters - General - Number of seconds....
Since new fights have lengthy idle time, this plugin will force ACT to end encounter when reading "has initiated a ready check", or when countdown reaches "Engage!".
